<h3 style ="color:blue"> Thinking </h3>
<br>
<p>Well here we are learning to code HTML and CSS. <br>
I feel like the captain of the big <q>MSS</q> <br>
Maybe I'll learn to beat the test <br>
And perhaps become better then all the rest!</p>
<br>
<h3 style = "color:blue">Learning</h3>
<br>
<p> Learning to code is one big heap <br>
If you leave it too long it will peep<br>
It will see past the walls in its box<br>
and leave you there with something like chicken pox! </p>
<br>
<h3 style = "color:blue">Doing</h3>
<br>
<p> You've made it this far in your coding journey<br>
now go on without a worry<br>
for with this knowledge you know hold<br>
you can make a world with it's <i>never</i> cold!<br>
The power of a wizard some may say<br>
But you can say no and get better pay!</p>
<br>
	<h3 style = "color:blue"> Finding!</h3>
